# Ethan Miller's PowerShell Utilities

This repository includes my various scripts and modules for PowerShell.

## Basic Setup
Open PowerShell as Administrator, navigate to scripts folder, then:
``` cmd
# Clone PowerShell scripts
$ cd $env:USERPROFILE; mkdir Repos; cd Repos; mkdir PowerShell; cd PowerShell
$ git clone https://github.com/ethanmiller1/PowerShell.git
# Run basic setup scripts
$ .\BasicSetup.ps1
```

Note: You may encounter errors when running scripts from your work network. Run scripts at home.

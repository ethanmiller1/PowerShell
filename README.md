# Ethan Miller's PowerShell Utilities

This repository includes my various scripts and modules for PowerShell.

## Basic Setup
Open PowerShell as Administrator, navigate to scripts folder, then:
``` cmd
# Install Chocolatey Windows Package Manager
$ .\InstallChocolatey.ps1
# Install and configure git
$ .\GitSetup.ps1
# Install software
$ .\SoftwareSetup.ps1
```

Note: You may encounter errors when running scripts from your work network. Run scripts at home.
